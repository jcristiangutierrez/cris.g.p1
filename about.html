      For project 1, my goal was to emulate a festival. Growing up 5 minutes away from San Francisco I was in the City often and always went to street festivals. Specifically Carnival, which is a huge street fest for Latinos/a of all parts. Where we come together and combine our cultures and showcase artwork, food, and best yet the old school lowriders. Growing up this was very nostalgic to me because I am a Chicano and I can closely relate to everything, the delicious food, the culture, and being raised in a Chicano environment. So not only was I trying to emulate a street festival but I also wanted to emulate the culture I was raised in and all the memories I have from growing up and going to these festivals. Overall I think I was able to closely emulate what I wanted and had a really great time with the project.
